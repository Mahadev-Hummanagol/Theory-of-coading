Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.
An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:
Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"
Output: true

def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    freq = {}  # HashMap

    # Build count for s
    for ch in s:
        if ch in freq:
            freq[ch] += 1
        else:
            freq[ch] = 1

    # Subtract using t
    for ch in t:
        if ch not in freq:
            return False
        freq[ch] -= 1
        if freq[ch] == 0:
            del freq[ch]    # remove empty entry (optional, but clean)

    # If hashmap empty ⇒ all matched
    return len(freq) == 0

def is_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    # If lengths differ, they cannot be anagrams
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

    freq = {}  # HashMap: character -> count

    # Count frequency of each character in s
    for ch in s:
        freq[ch] = freq.get(ch, 0) + 1

    # Reduce count using t
    for ch in t:
        if ch not in freq:
            return False  # character in t not present in s
        freq[ch] -= 1
        if freq[ch] < 0:
            return False  # more occurrences in t than in s

    return True
