Group Anagrams
Given an array of strings strs, group all anagrams together into sublists. You may return the output in any order.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]

Output: [["hat"],["act", "cat"],["stop", "pots", "tops"]]

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    groups = {}   # normal dictionary

    for word in strs:
        # create key by sorting characters
        key = "".join(sorted(word))

        if key not in groups:
            groups[key] = []

        groups[key].append(word)

    return list(groups.values())



🧠 How This Works (Step-by-Step)
Input
["act","pots","tops","cat","stop","hat"]

Step 1️⃣ Take a word
word = "pots"

Step 2️⃣ Create key
sorted("pots")  -> ['o','p','s','t']
"".join(...)    -> "opst"


So:

key = "opst"

Step 3️⃣ Store in dictionary
groups = {
    "opst": ["pots"]
}

Step 4️⃣ Next word "tops"
key = "opst"
groups["opst"].append("tops")


Now:

"opst": ["pots", "tops"]

Final Dictionary
{
  "act": ["act", "cat"],
  "opst": ["pots", "tops", "stop"],
  "aht": ["hat"]
}

Output
[
  ["act", "cat"],
  ["pots", "tops", "stop"],
  ["hat"]
]
